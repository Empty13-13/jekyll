You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight html %}
<header class="site-header" role="banner">

  <div class="wrapper"><a class="site-title" rel="author" href="/">Your awesome title</a>
    <nav class="site-nav">
      <input type="checkbox" id="nav-trigger" class="nav-trigger"/>
      <label for="nav-trigger">
          <span class="menu-icon">
